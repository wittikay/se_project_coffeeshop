![Coffee Shop](./images/demo/Triple%20Peaks%20Coffee%20Project.png)
This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

1. I'd like to adjust the page to have a mobile layout as well, in case it is viewed from a mobile phone. Currently, the page elements may overlap each other if the width is reduced far enough.

2. I'd like to improve the performance of the page. Currently, in the "Recipes" section, the animation I've applied to the background causes the page to stutter or drop framerate as it loads the element. For this, I will try and utilize at-rules and importing css for different blocks to try and improve performance.

3. I do not like the default styling for the date-time form in the "Reservation" section, so I will like to adjust this with a custom styling once I learn how.
